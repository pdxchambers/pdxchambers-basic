PDXChambers Basic is a simple blog theme.
 
== Description ==
 PDXChambers Basic is, as the name suggest, a simple blog theme. It supports a variety of WordPress customization 
 options allowing flexibility in presentation.
 
 ==Design Notes==
 Some specific design decisions were made in developing this theme.
 
 1. Top level elements in the site's navigation menu don't go anywhere. This is to accommodate touch devices which don't have a "hover" 
 function. Tapping (or clicking) the top level element will display the sub-menu items for that element. Tapping it again will hide them.
 1. Nested comments are only displayed up to three levels deep for small devices (such as smartphones and small tablets). This was done
 because at that level the container becomes too small and the contents spill out of their container. These hidden comments will display
 as expected when the theme is viewed on a device with a width greater than 767 pixels.

 
== Installation ==
To install download the theme's .zip file, then use one of the following methods to install:

=The Easy Way=
The simplest way to install the theme is to do the following:
1. In your WordPress site's admin panel, go to "Appearance" -> "Themes".
1. Click the "Add New" button.
1. Click "Upload Theme"
1. Click "Choose File", browse to the theme's .zip file and select it.
1. Click "Install Now"

=The Less Easy Way=
1. Extract the .zip file. You should have a folder called "pdxchambers-basic" with the theme's files inside.
1. Log onto your WordPress site using FTP.
1. Upload the extracted folder to your wp-content/themes directory.

Once the files have been installed, go your your WordPress site's admin panel and activate it under "Apperance" -> "Themes"
